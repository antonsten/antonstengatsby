~~As you may know, I don't think [new tools](/newtools) are key to success - hard work is. That said, coming from someone who loves to try out _all the new shiny things_, I think it make sense to compile a list of the tools that stuck with me.~~

**Website**

My website is a static generated website which is technical lingo meaning that it's not Wordpress and it doesn't require a database. This is great because it allows it to run a lot faster and there's nothing evil people can hack into. I'm happy with the setup I have now, I can write content on both my computer and my iPad and as soon as I commit the changes to [Github](https://github.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) automatically builds and publishes a new website. I could not recommend Netlify higher and the fact that it's FREE is one of the great wonders of the world. Their application looks amazing, performs great and they offer things like a great CDN, free SSL and image optimizing.

I use [GoSquared](https://www.gosquared.com) for analytics as I think they offer the best graphical interface for understanding my visitors in a clear and easy way. This site no longer tracks you through any Google service. [GoSquared](https://www.gosquared.com) is one of the biggest costs I currently have for my website but I use their tool every day.

My newsletter is sent through [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) (after trying Mailchimp, Drip, Convertkit, Mailerlite and then Mailchimp again, and then Convertkit again!). If you're like me and just want a simple user interface that sends emails to people on a list then Buttondown is for you. No sequences, no automations, no marketing and certainly no postcards (wtf Mailchimp).

I prefer the simplicity of [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/invite/antonsten) for selling [my books](/books/).

**Software**

I have my entire computer synced and automatically backed up to [Dropbox](https://db.tt/lmIc9aXR). If my computer would crash, I’d have a new one fully restored within a couple of hours. There’s no price tag on that.

I do all my design work in [Figma](https://www.figma.com). I was really hesitant to the whole "work-in-the-browser" setup but their app makes me forget about that. It does offer some clear advantages as developers on PC can access my files and there's no need for Zeplin or Invision anymore.

Whenever I get a new device, be it a computer or a phone, the first app I install is always [1Password](https://1password.com). It stores all of my password and their 2FA-logins. This is a life-saver as it allows me to have custom, full-length secure passwords for every website I use. It’s the one app I don’t think anyone should be without.

I’m tracking my time with [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com) and use them for sending invoices too. It's great to get automatic reminders of invoices that aren't paid!

I keep track of things to do in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/). I don't have a fancy GTD systems all set up, rather something far simpler.

For writing, I like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=a3b4edc52f61492aab6c770f4c9f8dbf). It's simple and lightweight. It exports markdown and it's easy for me and my editor to co-create in.

**Office**

I'm blessed with having my own office space and the tools I use here are carefully selected. After years of using a Macbook Pro with an external monitor, I finally took the leap in 2017 to switch to an [iMac](https://www.apple.com/imac/). The [iMac](https://www.apple.com/imac/) is one of the best Apple products there is imho; the screen is amazing, the computer looks great and works like a charm. I use a Macbook Pro 13" for traveling and an iPad Mini for entertainment.

One of the first bigger expenses I allowed my newly founded company to take on was this [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) chair. Never regretted it. I have two [IKEA SKARSTA](https://www.ikea.com/se/sv/catalog/products/S29084966/) desks.

I'm using both [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) and [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/) and everything plays through a [HomePod](https://www.apple.com/homepod/).

[Doxie Go](http://www.getdoxie.com/product/doxie-go/) is perhaps one of my best tech purchases. I use it to scan receipts that sync to a <a href="https://db.tt/lmIc9aXR" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> folder (that my accountant has access to). The Doxie Q looks great but I’ve used <a href="http://www.getdoxie.com/product/doxie-go/" target="_blank">Doxie Go</a> for years and years and it just keeps going. This purchase has paid itself multiple times over.
