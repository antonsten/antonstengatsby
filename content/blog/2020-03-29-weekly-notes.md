Inspired by [Dan Mall's Weeknotes](http://danmall.me/articles/weeknotes-2020-02-23/), I thought I'd try something similar. Let me know if you find these interesting or not!

## Work

- Held a presentation for the broader 20-person team at the [Herman Miller](https://www.hermanmiller.com) project I'm working on
- Worked on mobile apps for [RedRover](https://www.redroverk12.com). Finding a good balance between a native app and injecting a brand is difficult! And Android apps are still a mess.
- Talked to a new potential client together with [Jenny Johannesson](http://www.jennyjohannesson.com) which we ended up turning down later in the week.
- Prepared user testing sessions.
- Had 1-on-1 sessions with [Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com) and [Sarah Azpeitia](https://www.sarahazpeitia.com) about our project and generally how we're feeling in these crazy times. I'm extremely grateful for this team ♥️.
- 1-on-1 coaching session with [Dan Mall](http://danmall.me).
- Talked to [Dan Mall](http://danmall.me), [Jessi Hall](https://twitter.com/jessiofhall/) and [Joe Rinaldi](https://twitter.com/joerinaldi) about scoping new work.


## Personal
- Ran 5.5km one early morning and two home workouts.
- Date night with Tina.
- Therapy session.
- Had friends over for a lebanese dinner.
- Watched [The Gentlemen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B0RpUGss2c) - loved it, classic Guy Ritchie.
