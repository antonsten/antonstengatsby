>“As I was leaving St. Mary’s College today I was struck, not by a branch, but by your radiant beauty. You must get these messages all the time. You’re such an attractive tree.”**[When You Give a Tree an Email Address](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/when-you-give-a-tree-an-email-address/398210/){:target="_blank"}**

It seems like we're drowned with reports on how digital technology is making us less empathetic, more stressed and more filled with hate. This article comes as a breath of fresh air in that sense. The city of Melbourne assigned each tree a unique email address so it's citizens could report problems. Instead, people used the email addresses to send love letters to their favorite trees. ❤️ conquers all.
