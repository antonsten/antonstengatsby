Rob McWhirter in a great piece on how they worked with Twine’s onboarding to dramatically improve their onboarding:

>Reviewing our stats in January, we knew that our onboarding was letting us down. We were experiencing a big dropout between signup and trial (around 65%) and this was hurting our monthly revenue. We refused to believe it was the fault of the product —hey, we were getting great feedback from current users.<br /><br />A bit of user testing and some interviews confirmed that our onboarding was contributing to this dropout: people were signing up, but being dumped into the trial and left to work it out for themselves. When they couldn’t work it out, they would leave and never come back.**[{{page.title}}](https://blog.prototypr.io/ux-writing-how-better-onboarding-cut-our-drop-off-rate-by-45-44e1da0e4d9)**
