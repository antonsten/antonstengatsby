## Work

- The work we’re doing for [Herman Miller](https://www.hermanmiller.com/) is starting up again next week! I can’t wait to be able to get back to work and spend time with the awesome team.
- Signed a new client! Work will begin next week and it’s a client solely focused on solar energy. I’ll help them set the best possible onboarding experience.
- Launched a [simple questionnaire](https://ooto.typeform.com/to/bOTZjl) for Herman Miller. If you normally work from an office but are forced to work from home now, please help us out!


## Personal

- Played two football games!
- Easter break. Game night, pizza and beers with a friend.
