Clearly haven't done much last week - guessing it'll stay at this pace until early August. 

## Work

- Met with David from IDEO
- Copy work on my new website

## Personal

- Exercise: one football game, one rowing session and [one tree course](https://treewalker.nu)
- Dinner in Falkenberg with friends
- Watched The Greyhound
- Started reading ["Hell yeah or No"](https://sivers.org/n)
