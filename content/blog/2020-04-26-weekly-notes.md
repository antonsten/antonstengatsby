## Work

- More stakeholder interviews for my new client, which is [Eneo](https://eneosolutions.se/en-start/). Proud to be working on such a great cause.
- A ton of meetings with Herman Miller as we're planning work for our next phase _and_ finishing up this phase.
- Sent a proposal to a prospective client together with [Jenny Johannesson.](http://www.jennyjohannesson.com)


## Personal

- Played two football games (again!)
- My wife had an accident at work and suffered a small concussion. She's doing fine now but threw the weekly planning a curveball.
- Therapy session
- Got a [new tattoo](https://twitter.com/antonsten/status/1252530008553332738?s=20)!
