Tough, intense week.

## Work

- Performed 6 interview sessions (user feedback) with a total of 25 persons for Herman Miller.
- Worked on a number of iOS and web patterns for [RedRover](https://www.redroverk12.com).
- Made progress with our calculator for Eneo. Love our iterative approach to solving this problem.


## Personal

- Last week was difficult. My trusted companion, co-worker and friend (and dog), [Meta was put to sleep.](https://twitter.com/antonsten/status/1261319247164301312?s=20) Lately we have been noticing that she was no longer herself and dementia was setting in. I'm grateful for the 15 amazing years I got to spend with her, day and night.
- Played football, gym session and rowed 5km.
- Got a haircut.
- Therapy session.
