Getting two weeks of vacation from work means getting time to catch up on things I&#8217;ve been meaning to watch, read and do. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve enjoyed the most the past two weeks:

## Books

  * <a href="https://pjrvs.com/" target="_blank">Everything I know</a> by Paul Jarvis

    Instead of offering one-size-fits-all advice, Paul provides an infinitely flexible template for adventure. There is a better, more satisfying path out there, if you’re willing to take risks and explore new territory. This book provides practical ideas and questions to help you conquer fear, overcome inertia, embrace vulnerability, validate your plans and most importantly, launch the shit out of them.

  * <a href="http://www.bokus.com/bok/9789113037110/den-stora-bankharvan/" target="_blank">Den stora bankhärvan (Swedish)</a> by Carolina Neurath

    In 2010, the Swedish bank, HQ lost it&#8217;s financial license and caused a big stir in the economic market. A bank founded by two of the biggest names in the Swedish financial market had to file for bankruptcy, a first time ever in Sweden.


  * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Interface-No-brilliant-technology/dp/0133890333/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1437994730&#038;sr=1-1&#038;keywords=no+ui" target="_blank">The Best Interface Is No Interface: The simple path to brilliant technology</a> by Golden Krishna

    In this book, innovator Golden Krishna challenges our world of nagging, screen-based bondage, and shows how we can build a technologically advanced world without digital interfaces.</p>

Whether you’re working in technology, or just wary of a gadget-filled future, you’ll be enlighted and entertained while discovering that the best interface is no interface. </li>



      * <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy" target="_blank">The elements of Content Strategy</a> by Erin Kissing

        Content strategy is the web’s hottest new thing. But where did it come from? Why does it matter? And what does the content renaissance mean for you? This brief guide explores content strategy’s roots, and quickly and expertly demonstrates not only how it’s done, but how you can do it well. </ul>



    ## Magazines

      * <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" target="_blank">What is Code?</a> by Paul Ford

        Catching up on 5-6 of the latest issue of <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek" target="_blank">Bloomberg Businessweek</a>, I finally had the chance to read Paul Ford&#8217;s _brilliant_ article about what code is and why it matters to you.


      * <a href="https://thegreatdiscontent.com/magazine/issue-01" target="_blank">The great discontent</a>

        Finally had the chance to read through the entire issue 01 of The Great Discontent. I highly recommend reading at least the interview with <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/elle-luna" target="_blank">Elle Luna</a>.



    ## Movies (I&#8217;ll let the trailers speak for themselves)

      * Ex machina (4/5)



      * Chef (5/5)



      * Run all night (3/5)



      * While we&#8217;re young (3/5)



        (This would have been a solid 4/5 if not for the final passage).
