> A technical recruiter should be able to explain at a high level what a distributed system is, or the difference between a native mobile app and a web mobile app.

If that&#8217;s the level of tech that&#8217;s required (or worse, what&#8217;s aimed for) by Silicon Valley, I&#8217;m worried. I&#8217;m by no means a technical person, yet I could easily answer both of those questions to a recruiter &#8211; which a) means I could work as a tech recruiter and b) land a job a tech job in Silicon Valley. Nice to know there&#8217;s a backup plan I guess.
