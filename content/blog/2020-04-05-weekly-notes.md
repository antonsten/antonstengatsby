Weird week to say the least.

## Work

- My project for [Herman Miller](https://www.hermanmiller.com) was put on hold last Friday so this has been a slower week (well needed).
- Our first mobile apps for [RedRover](https://www.redroverk12.com) launched in private beta. We first started designing these three weeks ago so we've been moving along at a good pace.
- Final discussions with a potential new (exciting!) client. Hoping to sign contracts early next week.
- Attended a SuperFriendly all-hands meeting on how we can help companies in need during Covid-19.

## Personal
- Pilates session.
- Helped a friend move which was surprisingly relaxing and a welcome change.
- Went to [Pastafabriken](https://www.instagram.com/pastafabriken/) for a nice outdoor lunch.
- Watched [1917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZjQROMAh_s) - love Sam Mendes movies.
- Outdoor season of Sunday football started!
