>Therefore whenever I am lost, whenever I am not sure what I should do, whenever I feel trapped between stakeholder decisions, I return back to the keyword in my title—USER. I am here to remind the business that the user is not some mythical antelope or amorphous blob of millennials. Rather they are the most valuable aspect of their business, and in the end, best practices, conventions, trends, marketing ploys, and design programs don’t matter if their real-life user doesn’t or can’t or won’t.**[The golden rules of UX](https://uxdesign.cc/the-golden-rules-of-ux-375ac4f9b2d0)**
