              Growing as a designer is difficult. Most of us grow only through years and years of 'work experience' and while we want to grow and evolve as designers faster things get in the way. There's never the perfect time. There are no courses available or they cost a trillion dollar. </del>

                  After teaching at <a href="https://www.hyperisland.com/">Hyper Island</a> for nearly two decades, I wanted to bring the highlights of those experiences into my own easily-accessible, affordable course.
                  <ul>
                  <li>It's not a UX-course, but I will talk a great bit about how to create great user experiences.</li>
                  <li>It's not a course on presentation skills, but I'll teach you how to communicate more clearly.</li>
                  <li>It's not a business course, but I'll make sure you talk about design in a way that speaks to stake holders.</li>
                  <li>It's not a career course, but we'll identify where you want to go in your career.</li>
                  <li>And most importantly, it's a course with a curriculum that's flexible according to what you need, where you are, and who you are.</li></ul>

      <h2 className="leading-tight">Topics</h2>
      <p>Over the course of 5 weeks you'll learn how to:<br /><br />
      <span class="font-sans font-bold text-sm uppercase">Identify what role you want to have in a team</span><br />
      I've worked my way from design intern to Creative Director. From a freelance designer to a UX Team Leader. I know there is no role that is sunshine at all times, but I know you'll need to identify the role you want to be in order to enjoy those rainy days too. I will share my experiences of working in different roles and what I found were the upsides and downsides to all of them. Once you know what your goal is, I'll help you set a path to get you there. For groups, this can be used as an exercise for you to rethink your current setup or structure.<br /><br />
      <span class="font-sans font-bold text-sm uppercase">Talk and sell design inside your company</span><br />
      During the last two decades, I've worked with everything from one-man teams to Forbes 100 companies, from heavily design-oriented companies to technical process-oriented companies. Through each and every company and project, I've learned that there is no golden rule that works everywhere. I will help you find your voice within your company to make you more confident in talking about - and selling - design internally. How do you make sure you are the one presenting your design? And even more importantly, how do you feel confident doing it? I will share the techniques I use when presenting design that will get your project approved.<br /><br />
      <span class="font-sans font-bold text-sm uppercase">Structure projects like a professional</span><br />
      Once your project is approved, how do you set it up to work as efficiently as possible especially when you run 5 or 6 projects at once? I will share my techniques for running multiple projects at the same time, what tools I use, how I have them set up, and how I schedule my time!<br /><br />
      <span class="font-sans font-bold text-sm uppercase">Per request / Optional: One-to-one's!</span><br /> You'll get private access to me where you can discuss whatever you want to. These discussions are NDA-covered, so you can discuss real-life scenarios that you're working with or keep it on a more general level. Either way, a great way to have more in-depth discussions leading to solutions catered to your needs.<br /><br />

      <h2 className="leading-tight">Who's this for?</h2>
      <p>You're already a designer and, most likely, have worked as one for many years. Perhaps you're the only designer internally at your company and want to understand how to grow to something more. Maybe you're even on the verge of hiring your second designer and unsure about what that will mean for you. Perhaps you're a designer within a company full of designers, but are finding it difficult to see what's next and how to communication your need to grow. You could be a team that wants to find better ways of working together as well as within the company. Any of these situations - and more - I'll be able to help you find your next steps.</p>

      <p><span class="font-sans font-bold text-sm uppercase">Online classes:</span><br/> 10 hours in total including private one-to-one's. Everything is in real time so there's always an opportunity to ask questions, comment, and disagree (great conversations can come from disagreement!).</p>

      <p><span class="font-sans font-bold text-sm uppercase">Times:</span><br/> Depending on the class participants I'll be flexible to what works for most of you, but expect 2 hours in the afternoon (CET) / in the late morning (EST) / in the early morning (PST).</p>

      <p>I have more than 2 decades of experience working with digital products and have taught classes at world-renowned Hyper Island for more than a decade, having witnessed and experienced what works and what doesn’t. I’ve taught hundreds of students over the years in what is key to creating great user experiences as well as how to find a career that allows you to do your very best work. </p>

      <h2 className="leading-tight">Sell it to your boss</h2>
      <p>There’s the old joke: the CFO asks the CEO what happens if we spend this money on educating our employees and they decide to leave? The CEO responds, what if we don’t and they decide to stay?
      <br /><br />
      Educating employees is critical for any company's growth and success. By working more efficiently and removing friction, you'll see happier and more motivated employees.</p>
