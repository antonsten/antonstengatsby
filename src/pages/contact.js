              One of my favorite things about this job is the variety, in clients and projects (as you can see from <Link to="work">my portfolio</Link>). So whether you‚Äôre a multi-national behemoth or a team that can all fit into a mid-size sedan, get in touch and tell me what you have in mind ‚Äî I can‚Äôt wait to hear all about it!
